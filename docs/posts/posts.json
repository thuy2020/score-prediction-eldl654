To expand the number of predictors in our models, the following steps were taken:\nFRL (6 variables) and student_count (2 variables) imported and joined together by ncessch variable.\nTwo variables created in the FRL dataset:\nproportion of students who qualify for free and reduced lunch\nproportion of students who qualify for reduced price lunch\n\nEthnicities data imported\nThe original 7% sample of the training data was joined with the FRL and Ethnicities datasets to increase the total number of variables to 55 across `3,263 observations.\nScore Variable\nWe’re interested in predicting the students’ score based on their attributes. The range of the outcome variable is as follows:\nSummary\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n   1821    2420    2497    2498    2575    3550 \n\nDistribution\nThe distribution of of the 7% random sample of scores is a normal distribution. Additionally, there are no apparent skew or outliers.\n\n\n\nDescription of the remaining 54 variables\nID Variables\nVariable ID\nVariable Description\nid\nStudent

nominal varibales, except the outcome, with a missing value in a factor level are assigned to “unknown” level.\nAll numeric variables with a missing value are imputed by its median value.\nPredictor variables with nearly no variation are removed\nAll nominal varibales, except id variables and outcomes, are dummy coded\nAfter dummny coded, all nominal variables with nearly no variation are removed.\n\nAfter processing the data, we are left with 1 outcome variable, 7 id variables, and 39 predictors.\n\nData Recipe\n\nInputs:\n\n      role #variables\n   id vars          6\n   outcome
