the following steps:\nAll id variables are assigned to “id” role, which are not used as predictors\nAll nominal varibales, except the outcome, with a missing value in a factor level are assigned to “unknown” level.\nAll numeric variables with a missing value are imputed by its median value.\nPredictor variables with nearly no variation are removed\nAll nominal varibales, except id variables and outcomes, are dummy coded\nAfter dummny coded, all nominal variables with nearly no variation are removed.\n\nAfter processing the data, we are left with 1 outcome variable, 7 id variables, and 39 pridictors.\n\nData Recipe\n\nInputs:\n\n      role #variables\n        id          7\n   outcome          1\n predictor         39\n\nTraining data contained 1422 data points and 1422 incomplete
